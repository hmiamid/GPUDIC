This project I made in 2020 is for Digital Image Correlation or DIC. It's using the GPU using the Parallel Toolbox in Matlab.\
It has been written following the algorithm I read in: https://ncorr.com/index.php/dic-algorithms \
They wrote the Matlab software but in was compiled in mex and I wanted to convert it to a GPU version.\
So I rewrote an open source version of the algorithm.
